# General info
This is a demo-app of some stuff that do something, for example:
- Set up the server on Node with some tiny web scraping on google images (using puppeteer, raw html and google API)
- Use MongoDB to write data such as accounts (auth with passport) and (in the future) posts, comments, likes and all of that
- Set up the client on React and put some components together based on react material-ui so that they look alright and work well (kind of)
- Create a custom styling system using styles and themes from material-ui as a base
- Show cool renders of cool monsters in 3D modeled in Blender

This is a fresh living project that does not make too much sense but... it's fun and for show.
